ADO.Net : (Activex Data Objects)Is a data tier in the dotnet framework. It provides a bridge between the front end(appl, controls) and the backend DataSource.
-The ADO.Net encapsulates all the data access operations and controls the entire interaction with these objects to perform CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete)
- It hides the details of movement of data
- It uses xml to store and transfer data among applications, which is not only the Industry Standard, but also provides faster access to data for desktop/distributed application
